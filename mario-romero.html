<p>On September 2, 2012 My brother Mario Romero was Murdered By Vallejo Police Officers. 
Sean Kenney and Dustin Joseph, He was not suspected of nor wanted for committing a crime 
but he was frightened and attacked by these two officers with long histories of abuse on residents of the city of Vallejo. 
These officers on a slow night decided to surprised my brother by driving nose to nose to his car 
and flash a bright spotlight into his face while simultaneously jumping out of their patrol car 
yelling for my brother and brother and his passenger to put their hands up, all while discharging their firearms.</P>

<p>At one point Officer Kenney jumped on to the hood of my brothers car, 
reloaded his weapon and continued to fire as my family begged for him to stop. what would follow would be 
the Vallejo police Departments attempt to cover-up their crime and making my brother a suspect instead of a victim of 
rogue police.</p>
<br>
<p>His body was cut from his seatbelt and stolen from the scene of the crime and taken to the local Kaiser hospital, 
where Vallejo Police Officers were allowed unlimited access to his  body, while my family was not even allowed to identify him. 
This nightmare would continue for weeks.</p>
