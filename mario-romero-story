<div dir="ltr">Daniel,</div>

<div dir="ltr"></div>

<div dir="ltr">Thank you for reaching&nbsp; out to me, this journey for justice has been a difficult one , filled with its difficulties, heartbreaks and inspiration, trying to expose a crime that was committed that resulted in the death of a loved one and the &nbsp;domino effect&nbsp; that it&nbsp; has caused on your family is a very difficult task , trying to separate yourself from your devastation in an effort to paint a clear picture of how your loved one was brutality murdered by someone who has been in entrusted to protect your community is something you never quite learn to understand. I have been given this task, not by choice , not by desire but by force. the driven force is ...there is no other option, their is no way that this can be kept a secret.</div>

<div dir="ltr"></div>

<div dir="ltr">On September 2, 2012 My brother Mario Romero was Murdered By Vallejo Police Officers. Sean Kenney and Dustin Joseph, He was not suspected of nor wanted for committing a crime but he was frightened and attacked by these two officers with long histories of abuse on residents of the city of Vallejo. These officers on a slow night decided to surprised my brother by driving nose to nose to his car and flash a bright spotlight into his face while simultaneously jumping out of their patrol car yelling for my brother and brother and his passenger to put their hands up , all while discharging their firearms. at one point Officer Kenney jumped on to the hood of my brothers car&nbsp;,&nbsp;reloaded his weapon and continued to fire as my family begged for him to stop. what would follow would be the Vallejo police Departments attempt to cover-up their crime and making my brother a suspect instead of a victim of rogue police.</div>

<div dir="ltr"></div>

<div dir="ltr">His body was cut from his seatbelt and&nbsp;stolen from the scene of the crime and taken to the local Kaiser hospital , where&nbsp;Vallejo Police&nbsp;Officers were allowed unlimited access to&nbsp;his&nbsp; body, while my family was&nbsp;not even allowed to identify him. this nightmare would continue for weeks.</div>

<div dir="ltr"></div>

<div dir="ltr">The trauma to my brothers body would be so horrific that there&#39;s no way he could have been removed from his car alive. over 40 shots, 30 bullets entering the body of an unarmed man, shot by a Marksman who had killed an unarmed man months earlier and would kill again on the day my brother is laid to rest.</div>

<div dir="ltr"></div>

<div dir="ltr">Vallejo Police created a false story in order to cover-up a murder. Vallejo Police Officer Sean Kenney planted a police issued training weapon that can only be bought by law enforcement&nbsp;inside of Mario&#39;s car after he was murdered, the weapon was brought into the crime scene by Vallejo Police Corporal Stanley Eng. This crime was observed by numerous witnesses , including local law enforcement. Vallejo Police Officer Matthew Thompson attempted to distract witnesses while this crime was taking place, while Vallejo Police Officer &nbsp;William Clark , repeatedly expanded the crime scene to prevent observation of this crime and Former Cal-Martime Police&nbsp; Officer Andre Charles who was supposed to secured the crime scene observed the crime being committed but refused to come forward.</div>

<div dir="ltr"></div>

<div dir="ltr">It took seven long weeks before my brother could be buried, not because of our ability to bury him but because of Solano county&#39;s refusal to return his body and their hopes of a cremation. when my brothers body was returned he had bullet holes through the palms of his hands, bullet holes in his mouth, his bright white teeth had been shatter by bullet holes to his face, he had bullet holes underneath his arms from holding his hands in the air while begging for the police to stop shooting.</div>

<div dir="ltr">he was 23 years old when he was killed , 24 years old when we finally received his body but he looked like he was closer to 100 years old than the young age of 25. he sustained fatal wounds to every major upper extremity but this did not stop Vallejo Police officers from cutting him from his seatbelt zip-tying his hands behind his back and placing his corpse under arrest.</div>

<div dir="ltr"></div>

<div dir="ltr">Immediately we begged for our statements to be taken but were ignored. we contacted the district attorney&#39;s office to provide information that clearly shows that officers committed a crime but were told these exact words &quot;You have your attorney&#39;s and we have ours!&quot;. this statement pretty much warned us that we were on our own. we have been repeatedly harassed by Vallejo police officers, my disabled brother has been repeatedly kidnapped by police, he has had false charges brought up against him repeatedly, he was be told by Vallejo Police Officers Joshua Coleman and Kent Tribble that he is going to be their next project, He is currently sitting behind bars on false charges.</div>

<div dir="ltr">we have been wrongfully evicted and have had our cars illegally towed by Vallejo Police for standing up and exposing this crime.</div>

<div dir="ltr"></div>

<div dir="ltr">I am currently homeless due to retaliation for standing up to this injustice. I know that if I am silent my brothers murderers may continue to stay free. my family has traveled thousands of miles to share our story to every possible platform that is open to us. We suffer from depression, our rights have been repeatedly violated because of what we stand for and what we are trying to expose.</div>

<div dir="ltr"></div>

<div dir="ltr">When the Solano County District Attorney finally released his report he refused to acknowledge Mario as a person, he went along with police lies and refused to separately interview witnesses. He also made references to areas that did not apply. He attempted to&nbsp; paint my brother as a person who was a meth addict but failed to mention that certain allergy medications show up in the blood tests as emphetimines.</div>

<div dir="ltr"></div>

<div dir="ltr">Former Solano County District Attorney Donald Du Bain failed to properly investigate any cases of Police Officer Misconduct, sending a clear message that Vallejo Police above the law and terrorism on a local level is okay.</div>

<div dir="ltr"></div>

<div dir="ltr">I am excited to connect with all of you. I have learned so much since my fight for justice began, It is very encouraging to know that their is light at the end of the tunnel and possibilities where limitations once stood.</div>

<div dir="ltr"></div>

<div dir="ltr">Thank you guys for all that you do.</div>

<div dir="ltr"></div>

<div dir="ltr">Sincerely,</div>

<div dir="ltr"></div>
